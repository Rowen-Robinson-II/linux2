To log into a Linux Machine using SSH you need the IP address of the machine and the proper credentials. I will log in using a TryHackMe Virtual Machine.

<h3 align="center">Flags & Switches</h3>

<p>
A majority of commands allow for arguments to be provided. These arguments are identified by a hyphen and a certain keyword known as flags or switches. You can use cammands like "--help" to see which flags and switches are available to use.

<h3 align="center">Interacting With The Filesystem</h3>

<p>
The "cat" command is used to output the content of files (not just text!). After locating the "note.txt" file in folder4 I used the cat command to output the text, which is "Hello World!". Then I used the "pwd" to show the Present Working Directory, the current directory the user is in.

<h3 align="center">Searching For Files</h3>

<p>
Next I will use the "find" command to find the previous note.txt file without changing the directory. The "find" command will look through every folder in the current directory for the file specified. alternatively we could use an asterik (*) to search for a specific file."grep" is another search tool used for finding files.
