After logging into the virtual machine I used two basic commands "echo" and "whoami". "echo" prints out any text provided, while "whoami" is used to determine what user is logged in.

<h3 align="center">Interacting With The Filesystem</h3>

<p>
Command "ls" list all available directories/folders in the current directory while the "cd" command allows you to change directories

<h3 align="center">Interacting With The Filesystem</h3>

The "cat" command is used to output the content of files (not just text!). After locating the "note.txt" file in folder4 I used the cat command to output the text, which is "Hello World!". Then I used the "pwd" to show the Present Working Directory, the current directory the user is in.

<h3 align="center">Searching For Files</h3>

<p>
Next I will use the "find" command to find the previous note.txt file without changing the directory. The "find" command will look through every folder in the current directory for the file specified. alternatively we could use an asterik (*) to search for a specific file."grep" is another search tool used for finding files.
